            <h1>Work in Progress - Stephen Molyneaux</h1>
            <div>Student at the University of Waterloo, former co-op employee at Miovision Technologies, Arista Networks, Thalmic Labs, Vitruvian Engineering, and the University of Guelph.</div>
            <div>Above all I am interested in learning new things, and solving problems. This has lead me to spend countless hours learning about computer programming and electronics.</div>
            <div>Away from technology I also enjoy biking, reading, and playing board games.</div>
            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            C/C++

                <li>After a long haitus I picked up C++ to create a real-time vector drawing library, tetris, connect-4, and an OpenGL-based game</li>
                <li>Used a Vitruvian Engineering to develop a bootloader for a GSM-connected vending machine controller,
                    maintain a wireless fireworks control system, and develop the firmware for an industrial pressure control system.</li>
                <li>Used in my Algorithms and Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Parallel and Concurrent Programming courses at University</li>
            </ul>
            Python
            <ul>
                <li>Began learning Python in 2011 as part of a 4 month High School co-op, hired part-time until May 2013</li>
                <li>Used during my work at Virtuvian Engineering to program wireless transceivers for a fireworks control system</li>
                <li>Used during two separate co-ops at Arista Networks, first to model and graph the frequency response of the power planes of high-end networking equipment, and then
                    to create scripts for automated testing of networking equipment in manufacturing</li>
                <li>My goto language for everyday scripting</li>
            </ul>
            C#
            <ul>
                <li>Began learning C# in 2013 for my Introduction to Computer Programming course</li>
                <li>Used extensively at Miovision Technologies to maintain a legacy video processing system</li>
            </ul>
            Java
            <ul>
                <li>Began learning Java in 2012 to make applications and games for Android</li>
                <li>Used at Virtuvian Engineering to develop an Android app for controlling a wireless fireworks control system</li>
                <li>Used in my Embedded Systems Programming and Introduction to Computer Networks courses in University</li>
            </ul>
            Rust
            <ul>
                <li>Began learning Rust in 2017 to further develop my abilities in systems programming</li>
                <li>Participated in Singapore Rust Meetup group, and helped new users learn the language</li>
                <li>At this point I've only made toy applications</li>
            </ul>
            Others
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript - I've used JavaScript a fair amount, but my knowledge is stuck in 2007/2008 when I first learned it</li>
                <li>VHDL - Used in two digital logic courses at university, and I'm comfortable with it, but doesn't have much everyday use</li>
                <li>Haskell - I've played around with Haskell a little bit, and it's something I'd like to explore more of</li>
